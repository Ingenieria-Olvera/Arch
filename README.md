I lost the actual CAD file because I forgot to transfer my CAD files from my school fusion360 account to my personal account, yet here are picture examples of what it looks like.

For the mirror I ensured that the mirror would be at a 45% angle in order for the light from my oled would properly bounce off it and into my lenses. Additionally for the oled holding, I measured the oled and placed holders for the oled where the skrew holes are in order to hold it up while not covering the screen.

And of course the display does have some problems when being looked at in a very bright room, yet it is still visiable and doing its job in any light. And while it is hard to take a picture that truly conveys what it's like seeing a sort of holographic image, this is the best I got.
